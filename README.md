# 🔐 Caesar Cipher Encryption Tool (Python)

This is a simple and educational implementation of the **Caesar Cipher**, a classic encryption algorithm. Built using **pure Python**, the tool encrypts user-input text by shifting each letter by **+3 positions**, while leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged.

## 📌 Features

- 🔄 Wraps around alphabet (`Z → C`, `z → c`)
- 🔐 Encrypts both **uppercase** and **lowercase** letters
- 🧩 Non-letter characters (e.g. numbers, spaces, punctuation) are preserved
- 🧠 Great beginner project to understand character encoding, ASCII, and modular arithmetic

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- 💻 **Python 3**
- 📊 ASCII manipulation (`ord()` / `chr()`)
- 🔢 Modular arithmetic for letter rotation

---

## 🧪 Example

```text
Input:  Hello, World!
Output: Khoor, Zruog!
